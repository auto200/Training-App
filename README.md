# IMPORTANT

If you want to test your application during development on other devices in your local network, change start script in `package.json` accordingly:
`"start": "gatsby develop -H HOST_LOCAL_IP -p PORT",`
It defaults to my local ip.
If you don't care about other devices just change it like so:
`"start": "gatsby develop",`
Default port (no port specified) is 8000

Then start the app with:

```
npm run start
```

The app should now be up and running at http://localhost:8000 ðŸš€ _if not specified otherwise_
